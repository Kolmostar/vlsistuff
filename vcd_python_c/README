This version of vcd_python is written in C. So it is much faster than pure python.

to compile, just run (and first -  modify to match Your system) "compile_on_my_mac" or linux.

this should produce vcd_python executable right here.
You need decent python 2.7 on Your system.
especially library. Most problems come from the location of these libraries and setup of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar $DYLD.....

Once past these problems,  
try demo - script called "run".


to activate vcd_python: (as shown in "run") :

vcd_python <VCDFILE> <PYTHONFILE>   [-start Time] [-end Time]

(mind You, some options were not debugged yet).


vcd_python (C version) demands slightly different setup file from all python implementatio (vcd_python2).

1. import veri    # this connects python to C.
2. veri.peek(Net)   is used to peek on values in VCD.
3. instead of 
    Monitors = [('clk',negedge,Base)]
 use:
    veri.sensitive('tb.clk','0',"negedge()")
4. negedge doesnt get time parameter.
   use veri.stime()  function to read current simulation time.
   
try it and the see the speed.
