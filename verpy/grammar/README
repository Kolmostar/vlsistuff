generation of verilog parsing tables from yacc syntax description.
the script "compile" runs yacc (should be in your $PATH) and then translates the listing 
file to python parsing state machine.



the end result verilog_yacc_table.py  should be moved to ../pybin/  
every time the yacc file changes.
