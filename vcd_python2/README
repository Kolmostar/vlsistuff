local script "run" should run the demo.
python2.7 is expected here.  You can add "python" to the invocation line (inside run) if Your linux/mac is 
not allowing "#! /usr/bin/python" invocation.


the scripts reside in pybin/ directory.

typing :   pybin/vcd_python.py  will print short help and example.

vcd.py is the user written module called by "run".


new in this version:
1. removed all complex to use functions. 
2. You, the user, should define  

Base = 'tb.dma.fifo...'   - path to interesting scope.
def negedge(Time):        - function to be called when relevant clock falls.
    this function (can be named whatever) is the main working part.
Monitors = [('clk',negedge,Base)]
the vcd_python.py script reads the Monitors list and calls all functions mentioned,
when their clock falls.







this software used extensively on macs and linuxes :)
if You try it on windows, i would appreciate a short explanation, that i can add.

any feedback is positive.


the example here is AXI master talking to AXI slave.
