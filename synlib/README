first read/browse the file "run.py"
it explains what is inside.

files  in here:
run.py    ---- main script to run this demo and use as a base for real things.
imortant_files  --- i put there the demo synopsys library.  in run.py You can point to any other place.

syntmp/         --- holds .lib file for each cell (after splitting the big .lib files)
                    splitting is a convinience. and it speeds up working on large files.

descriptions/    --- holds python description per cell
src/             --- holds C source files for synlib_lexer executable. it is the only C app here.
llbin/           ---  holds all scripts and executables.
cellsLibrary.py  --- is the outcome of running here. it has cells library description in python. read it.
                     it doesnt have all the info from liberty, just what we need.



to run type:   run.py

in llbin, following scripts: (just so you know, because everything is spelled out in run.py)

assemblyCellLibrary.py     :    concat descriptions into one python file. adds class header.
compile_lexer              :    compile the only C program.
synlib_lexer               : synlib lexer C app.
