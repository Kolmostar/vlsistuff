genver.py is macro preprocessing script using python as macro language.

mostly i use it to expand verilog files (spiced with special python commands).
in many cases it is just to avoid using complex "generate" constructs.

to run example do:

pybin/genver.py example/example.vvv

or 

pybin/genverm1.py example/m1.vvv

this will produce example.v

check it out and see how it was derived from .vvv file.
there is always execme.py temporary file created. You may delete it.

some rules (they also appear in the pybin script itself):

any line that starts with "#" is considered part of python
any other line is treated as text to be modified and outputed.

line like this:
#AA = 6
assigns the value to python variable AA. ( you should keep " = " surrounded by spaces, for my script to recognize variable
text line (that has not # as first char)  like this:

assign (weak0,weak1) cucuAA = 100-AA;

will come out as:
assign (weak0,weak1) cucu6 = 100-6;

this is simple substitution of every AA to it's value. 
this is the reason i give the python variables names that not appear anywhere by chance.

python is very sensitivie to indentation. my script needs every indentation to be of FOUR spaces.
so for example:

#WID = 5
#for II in range(WID):
#    LESS= WID-II
##   ^
##   |
##   four spaces till here


to reduce indentation (get out one level of loop within a loop)
use line:
#<

#for II in range(10):
assign wwII = 0
#    for JJ in range(5):
    + cucu[JJ]*cooef[II]
#<
    ;
#

notice that single # in line closes all indentations (loops and ifs).


computation:
sometimes You want activate a function or computation and put in text the result.
for this use <>EXPR<>    <> - this tells the script to do computation (actually an eval).
then all of it is replaced with result of the expression.

#AA = 34
#BB = 768
assign net3 = <>len(bin(AA*BB))-2<>'d<>AA*2+int(sqrt(AA*BB))<>;
#
