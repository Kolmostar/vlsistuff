this example has jtag tap controller rtl that drives demo regfile.
!!the regfile is just a demo, built from XLS file, dont take it as working thing.

the testbench side reads STIL file (produced from jtag.seq file) and drives/checks the design.

it is emulation of a production tester. the STIL file toggles jtag interface to read/write few registers in the
design.

(The stilPLayer.py plays virtual tester.  it has roots in old SWAV format, so you can see "swav" appears here and 
there in the test).

This example is not completely baked, but it works and demonstrates python versatility as testbench.)

(by not baked, i mean that it was not completely cleaned from irrelevant baggage and stuff).
