example of creating python driven simulation environment of verilator.

first step in this example:

pyver.py rtl/fltserver.v -do verilator

this step creates few files in src/  directory.

next step:
src/comp  

running this script, will create (hopefully) obj_dir directory and makefile it.
it needs verilator executable and make and all the linux stuff.
it also links to python libraries (see the paths that need to be changed in src/comp
Makefile, written by verilator, creates executable.   obj_dir/Vtb

to run this executable,   obj_dir/Vtb -i 1.seq

1.seq is example of sequence file. 

study it. it imports helpers (dr (iver) and uart) .

The design in RTL, is uart driven floating point unit. It has 8 registers
writable and readable through uart and bunch of floating point operations on them.
