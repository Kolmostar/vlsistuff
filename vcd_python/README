local script "run" should run the demo.
python2.7 is expected here.  You can add "python" to the invocation line (inside run) if Your linux/mac is 
not allowing "#! /usr/bin/python" invocation.


the scripts reside in pybin/ directory.

typing :   pybin/vcd_python.py  will print short help and example.

vcd.py is the user written module called by "run".

it defines two "must" functions: observer and set_var.
vcd.py looks for clock going down and then, checks the AXI bus status.
it counts number of bytes moving around and keeps score.


this software used extensively on macs and linuxes :)
if You try it on windows, i would appreciate a short explanation, that i can add.

any feedback is positive.


the example here is AXI master talking to AXI slave.
